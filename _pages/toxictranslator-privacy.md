# Privacy Policy for ToxicTranslator

**Effective Date:** August 27, 2025  
**Last Updated:** August 27, 2025

## Introduction

Sahil Satralkar ("we," "our," or "us") operates the ToxicTranslator mobile application (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Service.

ToxicTranslator is designed with privacy as a core principle. Our app processes all text analysis completely on your device using local machine learning models, ensuring your messages never leave your device.

## Information We Do Not Collect

### Personal Information
- We do not collect any personal information such as your name, email address, or contact details
- We do not store any text messages or content you analyze in the app
- We do not track your location or access your device contacts

### Usage Data
- We do not collect analytics about how you use the app
- We do not track which features you use or how often
- We do not monitor your app usage patterns

### Device Information
- We do not collect information about your device model, operating system version, or unique device identifiers
- We do not access or collect data from other apps on your device

## How ToxicTranslator Works

### On-Device Processing
- All text analysis is performed locally on your device using Core ML models
- Your messages are processed entirely within the app and never transmitted to external servers
- No internet connection is required for the app's core functionality

### Machine Learning Models
- The app uses pre-trained machine learning models stored locally on your device
- These models analyze text patterns without storing or transmitting any user data
- All processing happens in real-time on your device

## App Store Analytics

The only data collection occurs through Apple's App Store Connect analytics, which provides us with anonymous, aggregated information such as:
- Number of app downloads
- General usage statistics
- Crash reports (if any occur)

This data is collected and managed entirely by Apple according to their privacy policies and does not include any personal information or app content.

## Third-Party Services

ToxicTranslator does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks. The app operates completely independently on your device.

## Data Security

Since ToxicTranslator does not collect, store, or transmit any user data, there is no risk of your personal information being compromised. All processing occurs locally within the secure environment of your iOS device.

## Children's Privacy

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.
