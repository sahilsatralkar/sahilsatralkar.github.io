## Context Composer: Open-Source, Privacy-First AI Text Transformation on iOS

Transform your messages with AI-powered contextual variations, all while maintaining 100% privacy on your device. **Context Composer** is an open-source iOS app that leverages Apple's groundbreaking Foundation Models framework, exclusive to iOS 26, to generate professional response variations without any data leaving your iPhone.

Built with Swift 6 and SwiftUI, this fully open-source application offers five distinct communication tones: Formal, Casual, Empathetic, Direct, and Diplomatic. Whether you're crafting a sensitive email to a colleague or translating technical feedback into diplomatic language, Context Composer instantly generates appropriate variations while preserving your message's key points.

The app's architecture showcases modern iOS development practices, including MVVM with @Observable, Swift 6 async/await, and the innovative Liquid Glass design system. As an open-source project, developers can explore, learn from, and contribute to the codebase. What sets Context Composer apart is its commitment to privacy â€“ functioning entirely offline with zero network calls, data collection, or cloud processing. Test it yourself by enabling airplane mode; the app continues working flawlessly, proving its on-device AI processing.

Available for iPhone 15 Pro and newer devices with Apple Intelligence enabled, this open-source initiative represents the future of transparent, privacy-conscious AI applications on mobile platforms.

### Questions About This Blog Post

Here are some questions you might have about Context Composer and this article:

**1. What inspired you to create a privacy-focused AI text transformation app?**
The increasing concern about data privacy in AI applications and Apple's introduction of on-device Foundation Models created the perfect opportunity to build something that offers AI capabilities without compromising user privacy.

**2. How does the Foundation Models framework compare to other AI solutions?**
Unlike cloud-based AI services, Foundation Models run entirely on-device, offering instant responses without internet connectivity while ensuring complete data privacy. The trade-off is the requirement for newer hardware with Apple Intelligence support.

**3. What challenges did you face implementing on-device AI processing?**
The main challenges included working with the beta iOS 26 APIs, managing token limits (4,096 tokens), and ensuring the app gracefully handles Foundation Models availability on different devices.

**4. Why did you choose to make Context Composer open-source?**
Open-sourcing allows other developers to learn from the implementation, contribute improvements, and verify the privacy claims. It also serves as a reference implementation for Apple's new Foundation Models framework.

**5. What are your future plans for Context Composer?**
Future updates may include additional tone options, custom prompt templates, conversation history management, and support for longer context windows as Apple improves the Foundation Models framework.
