## Context Composer: Open-Source, Privacy-First AI Text Transformation on iOS

Transform your messages with AI-powered contextual variations, all while maintaining 100% privacy on your device. **Context Composer** is an open-source iOS app that leverages Apple's groundbreaking Foundation Models framework, exclusive to iOS 26, to generate professional response variations without any data leaving your iPhone.

Built with Swift 6 and SwiftUI, this fully open-source application offers five distinct communication tones: Formal, Casual, Empathetic, Direct, and Diplomatic. Whether you're crafting a sensitive email to a colleague or translating technical feedback into diplomatic language, Context Composer instantly generates appropriate variations while preserving your message's key points.

The app's architecture showcases modern iOS development practices, including MVVM with @Observable, Swift 6 async/await, and the innovative Liquid Glass design system. As an open-source project, developers can explore, learn from, and contribute to the codebase. What sets Context Composer apart is its commitment to privacy â€“ functioning entirely offline with zero network calls, data collection, or cloud processing. Test it yourself by enabling airplane mode; the app continues working flawlessly, proving its on-device AI processing.

### Real-World Example

Imagine you need to inform your team about overtime work this weekend. Your initial message: "We need to work overtime this weekend to meet the deadline." Using Context Composer with the **Empathetic** tone transforms this into: "I know this is short notice, and I appreciate everyone's dedication. We need some extra hours this weekend to ensure we deliver on time. Let's discuss how we can make this work for everyone and plan some well-deserved time off afterward." The same message through the **Direct** tone becomes: "Weekend overtime required to meet deadline. Please confirm availability." Each variation maintains your core message while adapting the delivery for different contexts and audiences.

Available for iPhone 15 Pro and newer devices with Apple Intelligence enabled, this open-source initiative represents the future of transparent, privacy-conscious AI applications on mobile platforms.
