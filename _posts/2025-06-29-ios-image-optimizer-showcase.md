## iOS Image Optimizer: Apple-Compliant Image Analysis Tool

iOS apps often accumulate unused images and oversized assets over time, leading to bloated app bundles and App Store rejection. I created **iOS Image Optimizer**, a comprehensive command-line tool that analyzes iOS projects for image optimization opportunities following **Apple's official Human Interface Guidelines**.

### The Problem

iOS projects face multiple image-related challenges that impact app performance and App Store approval:

- **Bundle bloat** from unused images and oversized assets
- **App Store rejections** due to non-compliance with Apple's image guidelines
- **Performance issues** from interlaced PNGs and missing color profiles
- **Inconsistent user experience** across different iOS devices
- **Manual review overhead** for complex project structures

Existing solutions only addressed basic unused image detection, leaving developers to manually verify Apple compliance.

### What It Does

**Comprehensive Image Analysis**  
- **Unused Image Detection** - Find images that exist but are never referenced in code
- **Apple Compliance Validation** - Validate images against Apple's official guidelines
- **PNG Interlacing Analysis** - Detect performance-impacting interlaced PNGs
- **Color Profile Validation** - Ensure consistent colors across devices
- **Asset Catalog Organization** - Validate proper scale variants (@1x, @2x, @3x)
- **Design Quality Assessment** - Check touch targets and memory optimization

**Advanced Usage Detection**
- Swift: `UIImage(named:)`, `Image("name")`, SF Symbols
- Objective-C: `[UIImage imageNamed:]` patterns
- Interface Builder: Storyboards and XIB files
- Asset Catalog cross-referencing

**Apple Compliance Scoring**
- **0-100 compliance score** based on Apple's Human Interface Guidelines
- **Prioritized recommendations** ranked by importance
- **Actionable insights** for App Store approval

**Comprehensive Reporting**
- Color-coded terminal output with compliance scores
- Detailed analysis by validation category
- JSON export for CI/CD integration
- Performance impact assessment

```

### Technical Implementation

**Swift Package Architecture**

```swift
let package = Package(
    name: "iOSImageOptimizer",
    platforms: [.macOS(.v13)],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser", from: "1.3.0"),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/JohnSundell/Files", from: "4.0.0"),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/onevcat/Rainbow", from: "4.0.0")
    ]
)
```

**Apple Compliance Validator**

The core innovation is the comprehensive validation system that checks images against Apple's guidelines:

```swift
class AppleComplianceValidator {
    func validateImages(_ images: [ImageAsset]) -> AppleComplianceResults {
        let pngInterlacingIssues = validatePNGInterlacing(images)
        let colorProfileIssues = validateColorProfiles(images)
        let assetCatalogIssues = validateAssetCatalogOrganization(images)
        let designQualityIssues = validateDesignQuality(images)
        
        let complianceScore = calculateComplianceScore(
            totalImages: images.count,
            totalIssues: totalIssues,
            criticalIssues: criticalIssues
        )
        
        return AppleComplianceResults(
            pngInterlacingIssues: pngInterlacingIssues,
            colorProfileIssues: colorProfileIssues,
            assetCatalogIssues: assetCatalogIssues,
            designQualityIssues: designQualityIssues,
            complianceScore: complianceScore,
            criticalIssues: criticalIssues,
            warningIssues: warningIssues,
            totalIssues: totalIssues
        )
    }
}
```

**PNG Interlacing Detection**

Critical for iOS performance, as interlaced PNGs cause memory issues:

```swift
func validatePNGInterlacing(_ images: [ImageAsset]) -> [PNGInterlacingIssue] {
    var issues: [PNGInterlacingIssue] = []
    
    for image in images where image.type == .png {
        guard let isInterlaced = image.isInterlaced, isInterlaced else { continue }
        
        let performanceImpact = determinePerformanceImpact(for: image)
        issues.append(PNGInterlacingIssue(
            image: image,
            performanceImpact: performanceImpact,
            recommendation: "Convert to de-interlaced PNG for better iOS performance"
        ))
    }
    
    return issues
}
```

**Color Profile Validation**

Ensures consistent colors across iOS devices:

```swift
func validateColorProfiles(_ images: [ImageAsset]) -> [ColorProfileIssue] {
    var issues: [ColorProfileIssue] = []
    
    for image in images {
        if let colorProfile = image.colorProfile {
            if !isRecommendedColorProfile(colorProfile) {
                let recommended = getRecommendedColorProfile(for: image)
                issues.append(ColorProfileIssue(
                    image: image,
                    issueType: .incompatible(current: colorProfile, recommended: recommended),
                    recommendation: "Use \(recommended) color profile for better iOS compatibility"
                ))
            }
        } else {
            issues.append(ColorProfileIssue(
                image: image,
                issueType: .missing,
                recommendation: "Add sRGB color profile for consistent colors across devices"
            ))
        }
    }
    
    return issues
}
```
